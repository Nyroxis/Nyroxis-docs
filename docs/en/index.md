# What is Nyroxis?
Nyroxis is a lightweight, AI-assisted cybersecurity platform designed to protect **personal and unmanaged endpoints** — the devices that traditional enterprise security tools often ignore.

It provides continuous, privacy-first monitoring of your device and helps you detect suspicious activity early, without requiring cloud connectivity or technical knowledge.

## Why Nyroxis Exists
Modern cyberattacks no longer target only companies. Executives, lawyers, doctors, journalists, and even families are targeted on **their personal devices**, where they have no SOC, no SIEM, and no security team watching over them.

Nyroxis fills this gap by bringing **enterprise-grade visibility** to the personal level — without the complexity.
