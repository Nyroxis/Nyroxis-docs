# Introduction

Nyroxis is a privacy-first, lightweight cybersecurity platform designed to give individuals and professionals the same level of visibility and protection that enterprises receive — but without the complexity, cost, or cloud dependency.

In modern digital life, personal and unmanaged endpoints have become the weakest link. Laptops at home, personal workstations, and everyday devices carry sensitive information, yet they often lack structured monitoring or early-warning systems.

Nyroxis provides a clear, simple answer: **local security intelligence**, directly on the device, with encrypted storage and AI-assisted analysis.

## The Gap Nyroxis Solves
While organizations benefit from SOC teams, SIEM platforms, and 24/7 monitoring, individuals and small professional environments do not.

This creates a critical gap:
- No visibility into what processes, connections, or actions occur on the device  
- No alerting when suspicious activity happens  
- No way to understand whether the system is being targeted  
- No unified security timeline for investigation  

Nyroxis bridges this gap by offering a structured, intelligent, and offline-capable security layer.

## Our Approach
Nyroxis focuses on three core principles:
- **Local-first security** — all logs remain on the device  
- **Intelligent detection** — behavior-aware AI assistance  
- **Human-friendly visibility** — clear dashboards and explanations  

The result is a system that brings enterprise-grade awareness into a form suitable for families, professionals, executives, and cybersecurity practitioners.
