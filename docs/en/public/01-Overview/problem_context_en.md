# Problem & Context

Cybersecurity has evolved, but personal protection has not.  
While enterprises use SOC teams, SIEM platforms, and advanced monitoring, individuals and small professional environments remain exposed.

## Personal Endpoints Are Now Prime Targets
Attackers increasingly target:
- Executives and high-profile individuals  
- Lawyers, doctors, and professionals with sensitive data  
- Families and children  
- Remote workers and travelers  

These devices often contain:
- Private communications  
- Financial information  
- Legal or medical data  
- Access to corporate accounts  
- Personal photos and documents  

Yet they lack any structured monitoring.

## Lack of Visibility = Increased Risk
Most users cannot see:
- What processes are running  
- What connects to the internet  
- What files are modified  
- Whether malware or persistence exists  
- If someone is spying on them  

Without visibility, attacks remain unnoticed until it's too late.

## Why Traditional Tools Are Not Enough
Antivirus tools focus on signature-based detection.  
But modern threats rely on:
- Living-off-the-land techniques  
- Slow and stealthy behavioral patterns  
- Fileless attacks  
- Credential theft  
- Local privilege escalation  

These techniques require **behavioral visibility**, not just scanning.

## The Core Problem
There is **no personal-level visibility layer** equivalent to enterprise SIEM.

Nyroxis fills this gap by providing:
- Local monitoring  
- Encrypted event storage  
- Behavioral and AI-assisted analysis  
- A clear dashboard for human understanding  

All without cloud dependency or technical complexity.
