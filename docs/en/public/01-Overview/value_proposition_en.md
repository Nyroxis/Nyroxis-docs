# Value Proposition

Nyroxis delivers a new category of personal cybersecurity:  
**enterprise‑grade visibility, without enterprise complexity.**

Unlike traditional antivirus tools, Nyroxis provides ongoing situational awareness — helping users understand what is happening on their device at any moment, with clear insights and encrypted local storage.

## Why Nyroxis Is Different
Most security tools fall into two extremes:
- **Too simple** (consumer antivirus) → limited visibility, signature-based  
- **Too complex** (corporate SIEM/SOC) → heavy, expensive, cloud‑dependent  

Nyroxis is designed specifically for the middle ground:
- Lightweight  
- Privacy-first  
- AI‑assisted  
- Offline‑capable  
- Human-friendly  

It brings **professional‑level monitoring** into a format suitable for individuals and small professional environments.
