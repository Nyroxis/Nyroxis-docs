##  Purpose of Visual Analytics
Charts help users answer key questions immediately:
- Is activity increasing or decreasing over time?  
- Are there unusual spikes in processes or network traffic?  
- Which event categories occur the most?  
- Are there recurring suspicious patterns?  

Visuals make complex data simple to understand.
