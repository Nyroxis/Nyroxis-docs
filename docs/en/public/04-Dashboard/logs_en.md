# Logs & Search

The Logs section of the Nyroxis Dashboard provides a clear, searchable, and structured view of all security‑relevant events collected by the Nyroxis Agent.  
It is designed to give both non‑technical users and professionals instant visibility into what is happening on their device.

##  Purpose of Logs View
The Logs module helps users understand:
- What events occurred  
- When they happened  
- Which processes, files, or network connections were involved  
- Whether the activity appears normal or suspicious  

It turns raw system data into readable, timestamped entries.
