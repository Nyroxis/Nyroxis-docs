# Dashboard UI Design

The Nyroxis Dashboard is built to give users—both non-technical and professional—a clear, intuitive, and actionable view of their device’s security state.  
Its design follows principles of clarity, minimalism, privacy, and real-time awareness.

##  Design Philosophy

### **1. Clarity Above Complexity**
Security data should never overwhelm the user.  
The Dashboard transforms raw logs into readable insights with:
- Clean typography  
- Clear spacing  
- Icon-based cues  
- Color‑coded severity indicators  

### **2. Privacy-First Visualization**
All data shown in the Dashboard:
- Comes from local encrypted storage  
- Never leaves the device  
- Is processed entirely offline  

### **3. Consistent UX for All Personas**
The interface supports:
- Families  
- Professionals  
- Executives  
- Cybersecurity analysts  

Each user receives the same clean, structured layout.

##  Core UI Sections

### **1. Header Bar**
Contains:
- App identity (Nyroxis brand)  
- Navigation tabs  
- Settings & language options  

Consistently visible across all pages.

---

### **2. Left Navigation Panel**
Organized for clarity:

- **Events & Search**  
- **Detections**  
- **Correlations**  
- **Scenarios**  
- **AI Nyroxis (NyXIA)**  
- **Reports**  
- **Severity Manager**  
- **Rule Matching Builder**  
- **Settings**  
- **Help / Documentation**  
- **About Nyroxis**  

Each section reflects a functional capability.

---

### **3. Main Workspace**
This is the active view where users interact with:

- Timelines  
- Event tables  
- Context panels  
- Visual charts  
- Rule editors  

Designed with a three-column logic when possible:
1. Filters  
2. Primary content  
3. Details/explanations  

---

### **4. Footer / Status Line**
Shows minimal, non-intrusive information:
- Agent status  
- Last sync with local DB  
- Resource usage (optional)  

---

##  Visual Style

### **Colors**
- **Blue / Cyan:** informational  
- **Amber / Yellow:** warnings  
- **Red:** critical severity  
- **Green:** safe/normal  

Lightweight gradients may be used to avoid a flat, dull look.

---

### **Typography**
Readable, modern fonts:
- Semi-rounded  
- Medium thickness  
- Clear hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)  

---

### **Icons & Visual Indicators**
Simple, neutral icons that enhance understanding without clutter.

---

##  Responsiveness
The Dashboard is optimized first for desktops/laptops, but scales down across:
- 13” laptops  
- High-resolution screens  
- Ultra-wide monitors  

Touch-friendly behavior is optional.

---

##  Summary
The Nyroxis Dashboard UI focuses on clarity, privacy, and usability—ensuring all users can quickly understand their system’s security status without technical knowledge.
