# AI Engine (NyXIA) — Overview

NyXIA is the local AI engine inside Nyroxis, designed to analyze security events **without sending any data to the cloud**.  
It brings intelligent behavioral detection to personal and professional devices while preserving privacy and operating fully offline.

---

##  Purpose of NyXIA
NyXIA provides:
- Behavioral analysis of events  
- Detection of unusual or suspicious patterns  
- Local anomaly detection  
- Lightweight on-device inference  
- Zero data sharing outside the device  

It is engineered to enhance visibility without compromising privacy.

---

##  How NyXIA Works
NyXIA processes:
- Process sequences  
- Network behaviors  
- File activity  
- Privilege actions  
- Time-based patterns  

Instead of analyzing each event independently, NyXIA groups short sequences of activity to reveal hidden behaviors.

This makes it capable of detecting:
- Slow attacks  
- Multi-step intrusions  
- Persistence techniques  
- Lateral movement indicators

##  Key Capabilities

### **1. Sequence-Based Analysis**
NyXIA evaluates windows of events rather than single entries.  
This helps identify suspicious behavior chains that traditional tools may miss.

---

### **2. Local Behavioral Profiles**
NyXIA maintains a private behavioral baseline for each device:
- Normal daily patterns  
- Usual processes  
- Typical network endpoints  

Deviations are flagged as anomalies.

All baselines are stored locally and encrypted.

---

### **3. Lightweight AI Models**
Models are optimized for:
- Low CPU impact  
- On-device processing  
- Minimal memory use  

Perfect for laptops, home devices, and sensitive environments.

---

### **4. No Cloud, No Uploads, No Tracking**
NyXIA never:
- Sends data to servers  
- Uploads event logs  
- Uses online AI APIs ( Optional )

Everything is computed locally and encrypted.

---

##  Full Privacy Guarantee
NyXIA respects full user privacy by design:
- Offline-only  
- Encrypted input/output  
- Local inference  
- No telemetry  

The AI engine belongs entirely to the user’s device.

## Summary
NyXIA brings intelligent, privacy‑preserving behavioral detection to Nyroxis — offering real security insights without cloud dependency or data exposure.
