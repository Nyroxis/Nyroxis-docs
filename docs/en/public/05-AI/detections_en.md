# AI Detections

The AI Detections module shows insights produced by NyXIA — the local AI engine — when it identifies unusual or suspicious activity on the device.  
All detections are generated locally, without cloud processing or data sharing.

## Purpose of AI Detections
NyXIA detects:
- Behavioral anomalies  
- Suspicious event sequences  
- Rare or unexpected patterns  
- Indicators of compromise (IoCs)  
- High-risk deviations from the device’s normal profile  

These detections help users see threats early.

## Types of AI Detections

### **1. Anomaly-Based Detections**
Triggered when behavior significantly deviates from the usual device baseline.

Example cases:
- Unusual process activity  
- Irregular network connections  
- Unexpected file modifications  
- Activity outside typical time periods  

---

### **2. Behavioral Sequence Alerts**
NyXIA examines short windows of events to detect:
- Multi-step intrusion attempts  
- Script + privilege escalation sequences  
- Process chains indicative of malware  

---

### **3. Rare Event Patterns**
Highlighted when:
- A process behaves differently than normal  
- A new rare endpoint appears  
- Activity resembles early-stage compromise  

---

### **4. Persistent Suspicious Behavior**
Long-term anomalies, such as:
- Repeated failed connections  
- Slow privilege escalation  
- Unusual background activity

## Detection Details
Each AI detection includes:
- Description of the anomaly  
- Affected processes or paths  
- Related network activity  
- Severity rating  
- Contextual explanation  
- Recommendations (if enabled)  

Nyroxis ensures these insights remain understandable for non-technical users.

## 100% Local & Private
All AI detections are:
- Computed offline  
- Stored locally  
- Derived from encrypted logs  
- Never uploaded to servers  

Your data never leaves your device.

## Summary
AI Detections provide intelligent, privacy-preserving alerts that help users identify dangerous or abnormal activity early — with full local processing and no cloud dependency.
