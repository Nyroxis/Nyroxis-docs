##  What Nyroxis Does *Not* Store
Nyroxis deliberately avoids collecting or saving personal or sensitive content.

It does **NOT** store:
- Personal documents  
- Images or videos  
- Browser history  
- Location data  
- Passwords or credentials  
- Contents of files  
- User messages or emails  

Only security‑oriented technical data is retained.

##  Encryption Model
All stored data is:
- Encrypted at the moment of capture  
- Saved only in encrypted form  
- Never written in plaintext  
- Decrypted only in memory during read  

Encryption keys are:
- Local to the device  
- Dynamically generated  
- Never embedded inside the app  
- Not transmitted to servers

##  Tamper-Resistant Structures
Nyroxis uses:
- Hash‑chained event blocks  
- Integrity verification  
- Protected write paths  
- Anti‑tamper checks during reads  

This prevents attackers from modifying or wiping event history.

##  Data Retention Lifetime
Nyroxis keeps logs only as long as needed for:
- Visibility  
- Detection  
- Correlation  

Users may:
- Reset logs  
- Clear history  
- Export encrypted backups (optional in future versions)

##  Fully Local Storage
All storage is:
- Local-only  
- Offline  
- Encrypted  
- Zero cloud upload  

Your security data stays on your machine — always.
