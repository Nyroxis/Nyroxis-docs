# Offline Mode

Nyroxis is built from the ground up to operate fully offline — without requiring cloud access, remote authentication, or external APIs.  
This design gives users security, privacy, and full autonomy over their device.

---

##  Why Offline Matters
Operating offline ensures:
- **No data leaves the device**
- **No exposure to cloud breaches**
- **No dependency on external infrastructure**
- **No risk of third-party monitoring**

Users retain complete control over their security data.

---

##  1. Full Local Operation
Nyroxis performs:
- Event collection  
- Encryption  
- Storage  
- AI analysis  
- Rule matching  
- Correlations  
- Alerts  

All locally on the device.

Nothing is uploaded.

---

##  2. No Cloud, No Servers
Nyroxis does *not* use:
- Cloud processing  
- Telemetry  
- Remote logging  
- Online scanning  
- External data sources  

This eliminates entire classes of privacy and attack risks.

---

##  3. Local AI (NyXIA)
NyXIA runs completely offline:
- Behavioral detection  
- Anomaly scoring  
- Scenario generation  

All computed directly from encrypted local events.

---

##  4. Secure Updates (Optional)
Nyroxis can receive updates:
- Manually  
- Offline package installation  

No forced cloud connections.

---

##  5. Transparent Architecture
Offline architecture avoids:
- Background tracking  
- Invisible network calls  
- Cloud-based analytics  

Users can verify that Nyroxis does not connect to the internet.

---

##  Summary
Offline Mode guarantees that Nyroxis remains:
- Private  
- Encrypted  
- Autonomous  
- Fully local  

A security platform designed to protect users *without* exposing their data.
