# Security Model

The Nyroxis Security Model ensures that all monitoring, AI analysis, and event storage operate under strict privacy-first and tamper-resistant principles.  
This model is designed for individuals, professionals, and executives who require trustworthy security without sacrificing privacy.

---

##  Core Objectives
Nyroxis protects:
- Data confidentiality  
- System integrity  
- User privacy  
- Local autonomy (no cloud dependency)  

The result: enterprise-grade protection on a personal device.

---

##  1. End-to-End Local Encryption
All event data is:
- Encrypted at the moment of capture  
- Stored only in encrypted form  
- Accessible only through secure read-paths  
- Never written to disk in plaintext  

Encryption keys are:
- Local  
- Dynamic  
- Never stored inside the app  
- Not transmitted externally  

---

##  2. Tamper-Resistant Storage
Nyroxis integrates:
- Integrity checks  
- Protected write paths  
- Hash-chained event blocks  
- Anti-tamper verification during read/write operations  

This prevents attackers from altering logs or covering their tracks.

---

##  3. Private On-Device AI
NyXIA (the AI engine):
- Runs fully offline  
- Processes encrypted event data  
- Generates detections and scenarios locally  
- Never sends logs to servers  

Your data stays on your device, always.

---

##  4. Full Offline Operation
Nyroxis does not require:
- Cloud processing  
- Online authentication  
- External APIs  
- Remote storage  

This removes entire classes of privacy risks.

---

##  5. Minimal Data Retention
Nyroxis stores only:
- Security events  
- Metadata needed for detection  

It does **not** store:
- Personal documents  
- User files  
- Browsing history  
- Credentials  
- Location data  

Only what is necessary for security analysis.

---

##  6. Transparent Logic
The security model is intentionally simple:
- Local collection  
- Local encryption  
- Local AI  
- Local alerts  

Nothing hidden, no silent uploads, no telemetry.

---

##  Summary
Nyroxis provides a strong, privacy-focused security foundation:
- Encrypted event storage  
- Tamper protection  
- Local-only AI  
- No cloud risks  

A modern security model designed for people who value both privacy and protection.
