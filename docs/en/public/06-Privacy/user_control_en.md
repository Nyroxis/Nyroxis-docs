# User Control & Transparency

Nyroxis is designed to give users full control over their security data, system behavior, and privacy settings.  
No hidden processes, no background uploads, no cloud connections — everything is transparent and locally managed.

##  Core Principles of User Control
Nyroxis ensures that users can:
- See what is being monitored  
- Control what is stored  
- Reset or delete data at any time  
- Verify offline operation  
- Understand how AI decisions are made  

The user always stays in charge.

##  1. No Silent Data Collection
Nyroxis collects **only** what is necessary for security analysis:
- Logs of processes  
- Network events  
- File changes  
- Privilege actions  

No personal files, photos, messages, or browsing data are ever collected.

Everything is explained clearly in the documentation.

##  2. Full Data Reset
Users can reset:
- Logs  
- Metadata  
- AI behavioral baseline  
- Correlation cache  

A full reset restores Nyroxis to a clean state without leftovers.

---

##  3. Local-Only Storage
All user-controlled data is:
- Stored locally  
- Fully encrypted  
- Never transmitted externally  

Users do not depend on cloud accounts, online authentication, or remote storage.

---

##  4. Transparent AI
NyXIA provides:
- Clear explanations of detections  
- Visibility into why a decision was made  
- Scenario-based reasoning summaries  

AI decisions are designed to be understandable, not black-boxed.

---

##  5. Customization Options
Users can adjust:
- Retention duration  
- Severity thresholds  
- Rule-matching preferences  
- Notification settings  

All settings are optional and local.

---

##  6. Verification of Offline Operation
Nyroxis exposes tools and UI indicators that allow users to verify:
- No outgoing network connections  
- No background telemetry  
- No cloud dependency  

Trust is measurable — not assumed.

##  Summary
Nyroxis empowers users with full control over their data, full transparency of its operations, and the ability to manage, reset, or verify everything locally — without cloud reliance or hidden processes.
